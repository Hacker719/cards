            <p>Dear Ayush,</p>
            <p>Thank you for such a great friend you have been! Even though we have 
                been spread between two different schools for so long, we have still been friends. Even with all the 
                differences in culture in both of our schools, we have managed to share the same views. I think all I 
                wanted to say is, thank you for still being friends with me, even after spamming up B.
            </p>
            <p>From, Neel Redkar</p>
