To teaching us how to shuck a oyster, and play carrom. You have taught and helped us so much in our lives, grow as people and individuals. I just wanted to say thank you, to appreciate all you have done for us in the past year, from helping me with school, to making me the best boy scout I can be. You have always been there for us through the thick and the thin, and we will be there for you for your 51st birthday and forever! Enjoy today, because its the youngest you will be from now on! Have a,</p>
