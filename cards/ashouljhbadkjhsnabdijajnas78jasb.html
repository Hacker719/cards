            <p>Dear Mama,</p>
            <p>
                    Thank you so much for all you have done! you have been a GREAT mother for all of us! I love you through and through! You have always cared for us and beared through us (through the thick and the thin). You have always endured my many questions and actions. And yet you still love me, even though I am... questionable. You have been through all the years with Tai and I hope you are ther with me. You are always there, even when most aren't. I love you so much, that is hard to put in words. I love you more than a cow needs to moo. I hope you have, the best of valentine days, and hope you get lots of love! Now that this card is in a website, I know I cannot lose it! All I just wanted to say was                    
            </p>
